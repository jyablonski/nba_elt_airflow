# Airflow Project
This Repo is a local Airflow Deployment for my [NBA Project](https://github.com/jyablonski/NBA-Dashboard), with functional `ECSOperator` and `dbt run` tasks.  This is not currently used for the production ELT, as I cannot host Airflow on any Cloud provider for free.  

The template I used to get started is available [here](https://github.com/soggycactus/airflow-repo-template).
